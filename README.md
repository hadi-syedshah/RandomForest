```

## Dataset
The project uses `SocialAds.csv` which likely contains social media advertising-related features and metrics for analysis and prediction.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Python installed with the following dependencies:
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn
   - jupyter
   - numpy

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RandomForest.git
cd RandomForest
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook random.ipynb
```

## Implementation
The Random Forest implementation can be found in `random.ipynb`, which contains the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
